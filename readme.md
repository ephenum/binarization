# Manuscript binarization in matlab

This simple matlab function binarizes color or grayscale images and is particularly suited for manuscript images. 

## Getting Started

Install files in active matlab folder and call with a graycale or color image and a structural element such as strel('disk',50). There are two versions, with or without an additional threshold for difficult images. 

### Prerequisites

You will need matlab and the computer vision toolbox installed on your machine.
